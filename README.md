# ME 701 - Basic C++

Instructions:  For this homework, you will modify this `README.md` file.
Follow the individual problem instructions.

## Problem 1 -- Returning to War

Time for Code Wars again.  Remind me of your link.

**Replace `robertsj` in [this link](https://www.codewars.com/users/robertsj) with your user name.**

## Problem 2 -- Mastery of the C++

Complete 6 challenges in C++.  The kata doesn't matter to me--I just want you to get coding.

List the six challenges below by using the appropriate URL, adding more
lines if you're the overachieving type:

  1.  https://www.codewars.com/kata/52742f58faf5485cae000b9a/train/python (example that you should delete)
  2.
  3.
  4.
  5.
  6.


## Problem 3 -- Reflecting on Debugging, Testing, and More

Choose one of the problems you listed above for the following tasks:

  1. Before you begin on any code, read the instructions for the problem and
     understand the "software requirements."  Are they good?  Are there gaps?
     Explain.
  2. Now, look at the starter code.  Is there any C++ syntax that is not
     familiar to you?
  3. Look at the provided tests, which show (1) how the program (here, a single function) should be
     used and (2) how it should behave for certain cases.  Do these cases look complete?  
  4. Begin to code in the browser, or copy and paste into VS code (or your favorite editor).
     Remember, you can use the same sort of tests by using `unittest`.
  5. Develop your solution, test it, fix it, and repeat.  As you go along, describe what went wrong
     and, as you fix the bugs, why it went wrong.  By learning about our patterns of coding, we are
     better able to (1) prevent mistakes and/or (2) quickly recognize our mistakes.
